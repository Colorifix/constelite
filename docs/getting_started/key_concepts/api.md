# API

## Intro

API is a component of constelite that exposes protocols and stores to clients. 

It is an abstraction that separates the business logic of protocols from the way protocols are triggered.

For example, StarliteAPI, exposes protocols over HTTP. Constelite also comes packaged with CamundaAPI, and RedisAPI.

You can add your own APIs to handle other triggers.
