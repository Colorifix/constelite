Constelite is a framework for dealing with data exchange between external/internal data providers.

Problems Constelite attempts to solve:

* Standardising data models across various data providers.
* Decoupling logic of data processing from making read/write operations to data providers.
* Creation of various APIs to manipulate and process data.
